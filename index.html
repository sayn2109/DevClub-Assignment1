						<h3>What is COVID-19</h3>
						<p>
COVID-19 is a disease caused by a virus called SARS-CoV-2.Most people with COVID-19 have<br>
mild symptoms, but some people can become severely ill.Although most people with COVID-19<br>
get better within weeks of illness, some people experience post-COVID conditions. Post-COVID<br>
conditions are a wide range of new, returning, or ongoing health problems people can<br>
experience more than four weeks after first being infected with the virus that causes<br>
COVID-19. Older people and those who have certain underlying medical conditions are more<br>
likely to get severely ill from COVID-19. Vaccines against COVID-19 are safe and effective.

						<h3>
Should I use soap and water or hand sanitizer to protect myself?
						</h3>

Handwashing is one of the best ways to protect yourself and your family from getting sick.<br>
Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after blowing<br>
your nose, coughing, or sneezing; going to the bathroom; and before eating or preparing food.<br>
 If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with <br>
atleast 60% alcohol.
